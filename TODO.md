# TODO

1. Use TodoList as demo model.
2. Implement router for TodoList, viewing the TodoList summary information, or the list itself, or a detail view of one Todo. Use "paths" in props to views to make one view display multiple routes.
3. Connect router to a material layout.
4. Deltas (and key frames) from server to client.
5. Reconcile conflicting deltas from client to server.
6. Websocket keep-alive ping.
7. Websocket re-open on close with exponential backoff.
