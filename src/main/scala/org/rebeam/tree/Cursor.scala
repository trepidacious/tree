/**
  * Cursor giving a "position" in a data model, giving the model at that position
  * and a parent to be used to run deltas to update the model, as well as means to
  * zoom into the model (using a lens) to produce cursors for child data.
  *
  * Most commonly used by a view of a position in a model, since it provides the
  * data to display, and a way of applying deltas to the data at that position.
  *
  * @param parent The parent of the view using this Cursor. Used to convert
  *               deltas into Callbacks that will "run" the delta.
  * @param model  The actual model value for the child view - the data to display.
  * @tparam M     The type of model for the view.
