/**
  * Implementation of the Logoot CRDT based on https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00432368/document
  *
  * Acts as a List[A], but using an id per element of the list that has a total ordering, allowing
  * inserts, deletes and edits of elements from different clients to be merged neatly.
  * One approach to commutative editing of list elements is to give the elements their own Guids, and
  * use these to find them in the list for editing (or to put the elements in a Mirror and use a list of Refs),
  * thereby avoiding the use of plain integer indices into the list, which do not commute when we reorder, insert
  * or delete elements.
  * Using Guids works for editing and deleting elements, but does not give a commutative system for reordering or
  * inserting elements, and introduces a Guid that might otherwise be unnecessary. Logoot essentially gives
  * each element an associated id (including a Guid) based on its order in the list relative to other elements, which
  * is suitable for all operations. Note that this id is globally unique because it contains a Guid, but is only
  * valid within the particular Logoot list by which it is generated.
  *
  * Note that this implementation does NOT use the algorithms for generating new positions given in
  * the original paper, since I suspect they are flawed:
  *
  *  1. There is almost certainly an off by one error in generateLinePositions, which seems to have
  *     been corrected in the logoot-undo paper. This is obviously easily fixable but worrying.
  *  2. The generateLinePositions algorithm assumes that we can always generate a new position using just
  *     the "pos" integers of the positions p and q. However it seems to be possible for site identifiers
  *     to affect the ordering of position identifiers such that their pos integers are NOT in order, and
  *     this will then cause generateLinePositions to iterate forever.
  *     E.g. assume we are operating on two sites, using base 10 - if we have two positions that look like
  *     [2s, 6s] then [2t, 3t], where in each identifier the numbers are the pos values, and the letters represent
  *     the site id, and where s < t, we will order the positions as shown since the identifier 2s is less than
  *     2t. However we then just use the numbers "26" and "23" as the start and end "numbers" in base 10 of
  *     the search. With prefix size 1 we get 2 and 2, so no interval, with prefix size 2 we get 26 and 23, so
  *     "-3" interval, and then for prefix size 3 we get 260 and 230, "-30" interval, and so on forever,
  *     never finding a gap.
  *     Can we actually end up with a list containing [2s, 6s], [2t, 3t] as adjacent positions? I think we can,
  *     since we can start from an empty list at sites s and t, and on each site (in parallel without communications)
  *     generate 9 new positions - this fully occupies the first identifier, so we get
  *     [[1s], [2s] ... [9s]] on site s, and [[1t], [2t] ... [9t]] on site t.
  *     Then we insert a new line between [2s] and [3s] on site s, giving us a random choice for second identifier -
  *     say we choose [2s, 6s]. On site t we similarly insert between [2t] and [3t], but here we choose [2t, 3t].
  *     Now site s receives the newly generates lines from site t, and inserts them into its own list, ending up
  *     with [[1s], [1t], [2s], [2s, 6s], [2t], [2t, 3t], [3s], [3t] ...]. We then delete all but the positions
  *     having two identifiers, and get our example list where generateLinePositions fails.
  *
  * Therefore we use the simpler algorithm from https://github.com/usecanvas/logoot-js/blob/master/lib/logoot/sequence.js
  * This works on a strictly identifier-by-identifier basis, not assuming that the ordering using site indices is
  * consistent with the ordering using pos only. We just inspect each pair of identifiers and insert a single new identifier
  * as soon as we can.

    *
    * TODO An interesting approach to growth of positions would be to periodically regenerate them - in most cases
    * this could produce 1-length positions. We would need to track which "regeneration" of the position was being
    * used for insertion, and either:
    *   1. just reject old ones (confusing old clients), while presumably trying to avoid this by only regenerating
    *      when there are no clients connected, or
    *   2. retain a mapping from the previous generation's positions to the current, for long enough that all clients
    *      should have been informed of the new generation, or can be ignored because their lag is too great.
    *      So we would use a Delta to regenerate, and send this action to all clients. Until a timeout elapses, we
    *      would have both generations stored in the sequence, and old generation positions would be transparently
    *      updated to their new equivalents before inserting, and then at the timeout we would run another delta to
    *      remove the old generation. Any old-generation positions received after this would be rejected. Because the
    *      regeneration and dropping of old generation would be performed as deltas, they would be consistent when
    *      applied back on all clients. The only downside would be that dropping a generation would "kill" any deltas
    *      from clients that were generated with the old generation. However we _don't_ guarantee that all operations
    *      are commutative, we just require that they will either commute or do nothing when they cannot commute.

    *   1. All Identifiers have a pos >= minPosValue and <= maxPosValue.

    *     F. Identical to firstPosition, (minPosValue, 0)
    *     L. Identical to lastPosition, (maxPosValue, 0)
    *     G. Generated by this function
    *
    *   3. Only positions of class G, which we will call generated positions, are ever present in Sequences directly.
    *   There is one position of class F which is implicitly at the start of all sequences, and used for inserting
    *   new positions before the first generated position. Similarly there is one of class L implicitly at the
    *   end of each sequence.
    *   4. All generated positions have a final identifier with a clientId from the client that generated them.
    *   5. All generated positions have a final identifier with a pos strictly > minPosValue and < maxPosValue.
    *
    * Requirements:
    *
    *   1. All Positions in a sequence form an ordered sequence with no duplicates.
    *   2. We can produce a Position r between any pair of Positions p and q so that p < r < q
    *
    * Interface:
    *
    *   1. Sequences are only changed by inserting and deleting entries.
    *   2. Entries are inserted by generating a new Position between a pair of adjacent existing positions,
    *      i.e. two positions p and q where p < q and there is no position r in the sequence such that p < r < q
    *   3. Entries are deleted by simply removing them from the Sequence
    *
    * Ordering
    *
    *   1. Identifiers are a pos and a clientId, and are compared by pos then (if pos is equal) by clientId
    *   2. Positions are a list of Identifiers, and are compared identifier by identifier from first to last. Say
    *      we are comparing Positions p and q - if for all indices where both p and q have an Identifier, they have
    *      the same Identifier, then the longer position is considered to be greater. If Positions have the same
    *      Identifiers and same length then they are the same.
    *
    * Notes
    *
    *   1. PositionIdentifiers add a Guid to a Position. The PositionIdentifier is used entirely for ensuring
    *      uniqueness and looking up PositionIdentifiers directly. They are irrelevant for Positions themselves.
    *
    *
    * Based on the above, the only challenging task is to produce a function (this one) that can produce a generated
    * position meeting the invariants and requirements, to allow a new entry to be inserted into a Sequence.
    *
    * This can be expressed recursively. At each recursion we term the previous recursion's result l
    * (empty on first recursion), and choose a new ident ri to form the result of this recursion, r = l + ri. On
    * the final recursion this yields the final position f.
    *
    * Lets define an operator <|, where p <| r means that either p < r, or r is a prefix of p (including the option of
    * being empty, or the same length as and so identical to p).
    *
    * To produce the final result, we need r to meet all invariants and the condition p < r < q. When we cannot do
    * this in an intermediate recursion, we instead ensure we meet an easier condition p <| r <= q. This obviously
    * means that for all recursions, we have p <| l <= q.
    *
    * Note that when we choose to recurse, we know that ri will not be the final identifier in a generated position,
    * and so invariants 4 and 5 do not apply, which also eases the choice of ri.
    *
    * At each recursion step we perform three steps:
    *
    *   1. Produce a top identifier ti and bottom identifier bi satisfying invariant 1; i.e. they are not necessarily
    *      suitable as final identifiers in a generated sequence. These are chosen so that:
    *
    *        a. ri == bi      => p <| r <= q    // i.e. we can recurse with ri = bi
    *        b. bi < ri < ti  => p < r < q      // i.e. we can use bi and ti to find ri that produces final result f
    *
    *      where => is implication. (Since we don't have access to pi and qi after we have recursed outside the
    *      range of indices of the respective position, we instead use a proxy for pi and qi that DOES exist at all i).
    *
    *   2. Check whether there exists ri s.t. bi < ri < ti and satisfying invariants for the the ident itself and
    *      the sequence produced. If so this implies p < r < q and we are finished.
    *
    *   3. If 2 fails, choose ri = bi, so that a. implies p <| r <= q, and so we will reach a solution at later
    *      recursion.
    *
//    * We now need to show that p <| r <= q (and p < q) is sufficient to ensure that there is a longer
//    * position r ++ n for some possibly empty list of idents n, where p < r ++ n < q, and that the algorithm above
//    * will actually choose it.
//    *
//    * We start from knowing that p < q. This implies that either
//    *   1. There is an index i where pi < qi.
//    *      At this index we will choose bi = pi and ti = qi (see step 1 below)
//    *     a. If we have any of the terminating cases A to D from step 2, we will choose ri s.t. pi < ri < qi.
//    *        We know p <| l =< q so either l is a prefix of p and l + ri > p, or l > p, so l + ri > p.
//    *        We know l <= q, so l + ri < q.
//    *        Therefore in this case we know that we have a valid solution f.
//    *     b. If we do NOT have any of the terminating cases (i.e. pi < qi, but with no identifier between pi and qi)
//    *        then we will recurse, using ri = bi (see step 3), and we know bi = pi from step 1 below.
//    *        Hence r = l + pi. But since pi < qi, this means that any position having r as a prefix is < q; we
//    *        have ensured that all remaining recursions will fulfil r < q.
//    *        Therefore we only require that remaining recursions fulfil r > p; any identifiers will do this, they
//    *        just need to be valid.
//    *
//    *
//    *        We know that p <| r <= q for the next step, but actually in this case we know more -
//    *        we now know that r and any position with it as a prefix is strictly < q, regardless of length, since
//    *        the identifier pi is < qi.
//    *
//    *
//    *
//    *   2. p is a prefix of q, and q is longer.
//    *
//    * CONTINUE
//    *
//      * This is the necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a sequence r + n that fulfils p < r ++ n,
//      * where n may be empty.
//      *   p <| r is sufficient because either r is already > p, or it is a prefix to which we can add the remainder of p
//      *   and then any valid identifier to give a sequence > p.
//      *   p <| r is necessary. Consider if p <| r is not true. In that case p >= r, and r is not a prefix of p. If r is
//      *   not a prefix of p then there exists some first index i where pi != ri. But p >= r, so we know that we cannot
//      *   have ri > pi, so the only remaining inequality is that ri < pi, and so r < p, and for all n, r + n < p as well.
//      *
//      * r <= q is necessary for there to exist n s.t. r ++ n < q, if r > q then all r ++ n are also greater than q.
//      * p <| r <= q and p < q is sufficient for there to exist n s.t. p < r ++ n < q.
    *
    *
    * ## Step 1 - produce bi and ti
    *
    * At each recursion i, there are three interesting booleans:
    *   inP = i < p.size (i.e pi exists)
    *   inQ = i < q.size (i.e. qi exists)
    *   lessThanQ, which is true iff the prefix l passed to this recursion is less than Q with any suffix (because it
    *   contains some identifier less than the corresponding identifier in q)
    *
    * We choose bi and ti according to:
    *
    * if (inQ && !lessThanQ) ti = qi else ti = lastPosition.head
    * if (inP) bi = pi else bi = min(firstPosition.head, ti)
    *
    * We need to show that conditions a and b from above apply, note we have rewritten the conditions in terms of bi
    * and ti:
    *
    * Condition a is that p <| l + bi <= q
    *
    * First we show p <| l + bi. We know that p <| l, so either:
    *   1. p < l so that we must have p < l + bi for any bi, satisfying p <| l + bi
    *   2. l is a prefix of p, and either
    *      a. inP is true, then bi = pi, so l + bi is also a prefix of p, satisfying p <| l + bi
    *      b. inP is false, then l must be the whole of p, so l + bi > p, satisfying p <| l + bi
    *
    * Then we show l + bi <= q. We know that l <= q, and either:
    *   1. inP is true, and bi = pi. Note also that inP must have been true for all previous
    *      recursions, and since we reached stage i they did not return results - they recursed
    *      by appending bj at each stage j. So we know l is just the prefix of p up to i-1. Therefore
    *      l + bi is just the prefix of p up to i. This must be <= q, otherwise we would have p > q.
    *   2. inP is false, and bi = min(firstPosition.head, ti). Either:
    *      a. (inQ && !lessThanQ), so ti = qi, and bi = min(firstPosition.head, qi)
    *         TODO
    *      b. !(inQ && !lessThanQ), so ti = lastPosition.head, and bi = min(firstPosition.head, lastPosition.head),
    *         so bi = firstPosition.head.
    *         The condition means that either or both of the below apply:
    *         i. !inQ. So neither pi nor qi exists at this i. Therefore l contains all the digits chosen for indices j
    *            where pj and/or qj existed. Either:
    *              One. p is shorter than q. There was a first integer j where inP was false and inQ was true.
    *         ii. or lessThanQ. This means that l plus any suffix is less than q, satisfying l + bi <= q
    *
    *
    *
    * If inP is true:
    *   We will choose bi = pi. Now skip ahead to step 3 - this states that when we recurse, we always choose
    *   ri = bi ( = pi). This implies that the prefix at any recursion where inP is true is just the prefix of p.
    *   So we can see that if ri > bi (=pi) implies that r will be a prefix of p then a
    *   If inQ is also true, we choose ti = qi. This gives
    *
    * ## Step 2 - check for solution f
    *
    * We are producing a final identifier of a generated position, so we must comply with invariants 4 and 5.
    * Invariant 1 must be fulfilled by all identifiers including this one.
    *
    * Invariants 2 and 3 are fulfilled automatically, and Invariant 4 is fulfilled just by using the provided
    * clientId in all cases. Fulfilling invariant 5 gives invariant 1 for free, so we only need to worry about
    * invariant 5 and ensuring that bi < ri < ti.
    *
    * Note that when considering bi and ti, we can only rely on Invariant 1, but this is sufficient.
    *
    * We recognise 4 situations where such a final identifier exists (which may not be exhaustive), and which
    * are used in this order of preference:
    *   A. bi.pos and ti.pos are not consecutive, i.e. there is at least pos value strictly between them.
    *      We know from invariant 1 that bi.pos >= minPosValue and ti.pos <= maxPosValue, so all pos values
    *      between them meet invariant 5. We pick a pos s.t. bi.pos < pos < ti.pos according to a pseudo-random
    *      sequence that is provided to the function (TODO). This gives bi < ri < ti since identifiers are compared
    *      first by pos.
    *   B. bi.pos == ti.pos, bi.pos fulfils invariant 5, and bi.clientId < clientId < ti.clientId. In this case
    *      we can use pos = bi.pos (fulfilling invariant 5). This gives bi < ri < ti since the comparisons
    *      on pos are all equal, so we then compare by clientId giving desired result.
    *   C. bi.pos and ti.pos are consecutive, bi.pos fulfils invariant 5, and clientId > bi.clientId. In this case
    *      we can use pos = bi (fulfilling invariant 5). This gives bi < ri since bi.pos == ri.pos and
    *      bi.clientId < ri.clientId. We have ri < ti since ri.pos is one less than ti.pos (bi.pos and ti.pos
    *      consecutive)
    *   D. bi.pos and ti.pos are consecutive, ti.pos fulfils invariant 5, and clientId < ti.clientId. This is the same
    *      as C, except that we use pos = ti.pos (fulfilling invariant 5). This gives bi < ri since
    *      bi.pos < ri.pos == ti.pos. We have ri < ti since ri.pos == ti.pos and ri.clientId < ti.clientId.
    *
    * Therefore all cases A to D produce an ri meeting invariants and bi < ri < ti. These inequalities in turn imply
    * that p < r < q as required to yield a result.
    * If A - D all fail we will move on to step 3 and recurse.
    *
    *
    * ## Step 3 - recurse
    *
    * Already described - just choose ri = bi.
    *
    * @param p          We will generate a position > p
    * @param q          We will generate a position < q
    * @param r          The prefix of result already generated - we will add identifier(s) to this to produce result.
    * @param clientId   The clientId to be used for the final identifier in the result
    * @return           A Position > p and < q and meeting invariants
