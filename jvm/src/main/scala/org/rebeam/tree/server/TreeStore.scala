/**
  * Handles dispatching between three streams of data, in
  * order to synchronise a single client with a data model.
  * The streams are:
  * 1. Deltas to a model. These are accepted as a steam of D instances,
  * and contain enough information to fully monitor a model. For example
  * in a simple case these could be just new entire models as immutable
  * data. In a more complex case this could be a stream of "key frames"
  * giving the entire model, and "delta frames" giving changes to it, where
  * we obviously expect to start with a key frame.
  * 2. Incoming messages from the client, generally containing requests from
  * that client to modify the model.
  * 3. Outgoing messages that should be supplied to the client to update it.
  *
  * The dispatcher is not thread safe, and must be called from only one thread
  * at any given time - for example use a Lock and apply it around the calls
  * to each method. The Dispatcher can then be written to expect a serialised
  * stream of calls to its three methods.
  *
  * @tparam D The type of delta to the model
  * @tparam I The type of message from the client
  * @tparam O The type of message to the client

  * OutgoingDispatcher already has a message then it will be provided
  * immediately, otherwise the callback will be stored and as soon as
  * new data is observed it will be provided to the callback. These operations
  * are synchronised with the lock from the dispatcher.
  * In essence this provides a bridge between a callback to Observer that
  * receives updates to a model, a Process that provides messages to a client,
  * and a msgFromClient method that can accept messages from a client.
