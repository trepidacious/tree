/**
  * Uses an OutgoingDispatcher to provide Observer implementation.
  * Values provided to observe are passed on to an OutgoingDispatcher.
  * In addition, a pull method is provided. This accepts a callback, and
  * will provide data to that callback as soon as possible - if the
  * OutgoingDispatcher already has a message then it will be provided
  * immediately, otherwise the callback will be stored and as soon as
  * new data is observed it will be provided to the callback. These operations
  * are synchronised with the lock from the dispatcher.
  * In essence this provides a bridge between a callback to Observer that
  * receives updates to a model, a Process that provides messages to a client,
  * and a msgFromClient method that can accept messages from a client.
  *
  * @param d The dispatcher
  * @tparam D The type of delta to the model
  * @tparam I The type of message from the client
  * @tparam O The type of message to the client
